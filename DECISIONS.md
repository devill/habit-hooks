# DECISIONS

Reversible design calls made by the autonomous loop while driving GOAL.md.
Each is labelled _agent decision_ per the working agreement.

## Phase 1 — Smell-key decoupling (TS, internal)

- **Routing keys become canonical smell keys.** _(agent decision)_ Each `Rule.id`
  and each `Violation.ruleId` is now a kebab-case smell key (e.g.
  `too-many-parameters`) instead of a tool-prefixed key (`eslint:max-params`).
  Tool-prefixed strings survive **only** as (a) the raw→smell translation tables
  owned by each wrap and (b) provenance written to `Violation.source`.

- **`Violation.source` added for provenance.** _(agent decision)_ Carries the raw
  tool key (`eslint:max-params`, `knip:classMembers`, `jscpd:duplication`,
  `comment:non-essential`). It is shown in the reporter's _Uncoached_ section so
  today's behaviour — surfacing the originating tool/rule for unknown findings —
  is preserved. Maps cleanly onto the future `Issue.details.source` (docs).

- **Unmapped raw keys pass through as their bare key.** _(agent decision)_ An
  eslint rule with no smell mapping (e.g. `no-console`) routes as `no-console`;
  an unknown knip issue type (e.g. `unlistedPeerDependencies`) routes under its
  bare key. No tool prefix leaks into the routing key; the finding still surfaces
  as uncoached with full provenance in `source`.

- **Catalogue content preserved verbatim.** _(agent decision)_ Titles,
  descriptions, and severities are copied unchanged from the old tool-keyed rules
  to guarantee output parity. Aligning titles with `docs/smell-vocabulary.md`
  (e.g. "Non-essential comment") is deferred as a separate content change.

- **`parse-error` stays a supplemental prompt** (no default `Rule`), exactly as
  the old `eslint:fatal` did — it has a tuned template but no catalogue entry.
